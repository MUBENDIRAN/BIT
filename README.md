## üì° Project Overview

**BIT (Blynk IoT ThingSpeak)** is a smart home automation prototype built using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, the **Blynk cloud platform** for mobile-based device control, and **ThingSpeak** for real-time device status logging and visualization. It demonstrates **remote switching** of electronic appliances and **live telemetry monitoring** using simple HTTP APIs over Wi-Fi.

> Easily adaptable for smart homes, energy-saving systems, and remote IoT control environments.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Boot & Wi-Fi:** ESP32 powers up and connects to a predefined Wi-Fi network.
2. **Blynk Cloud:** It authenticates using a token and connects to the Blynk platform.
3. **Mobile App Commands:** Commands are sent via Virtual Pins (V0‚ÄìV2) through the Blynk app.
4. **Device Switching:** GPIO23 controls a relay module to switch appliances ON/OFF.
5. **Status Logging:** Real-time device state is pushed to ThingSpeak using HTTP GET requests for visualization and analytics.
